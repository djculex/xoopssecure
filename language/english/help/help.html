    <h1 class="head">What it does</h1>
        <h5 class="odd">Scan for missing Index files</h5>
        <p class="even">
            Missing index files is if the server is not secured against directory browsing a way for visitors to see all the content<br>
            of your folders. An index file giving a "no permission" or "error 404" will prevent this.<br><br> 
            This scan will create - if you permit it - these index files where missing.
            Check files and folders for right permissions<br>
        </p>
        <h5 class="odd">Check files and folders permissions</h5>
        <p class="even">
            Some files and folders ought to have certaing permissions set. For instance read only or writable<br>
            This scan will check these files and folders and if configured set the right permissions<br>
        </p>
        <h5 class="odd">Check files and folders for malware</h5>
        <p class="even">
            While this modules will not identify ALL malware out there, it will look for know hacker names, malware patterns and know<br>
            bad guys that could suddently be added to your script.<br><br>It does NOT have the ability to automaticly remove them and <br>
            some results could be coincidences but it will give you a scan log to see what is found at least.
        </p>
        <h5 class="odd">Check Coding Standards</h5>
        <p class="even">
            This scan will go through pages in a defined folder to check for issues concerning development. It is not as effective as for instance<br>
            phpcodesniffer, but it will find the most obvious sinners agains PSR-12 & Xoops Coding Standards.<br><br>Some indications of what maybe should be changed..some not<br>
            Same options of deleting, ignoring etc as the other scans are possible.
        </p>
        <h5 class="odd">Check server settings</h5>
        <p class="even">
            Looking through the server config, software and frameworks<br><br>
            If a hosted web this could be difficult to change, but in local and your own server this could be helpfull to close a few gaps<br><br>
            This page will also display eventual issues concerning MySql, Xoops and Apache. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="odd">Automatic / cron scan</h5> 
        <p class="even">
            Here you could config automatically scanning for changes in your pages. The result will be sent admin email. If a lot of pages suddently have been modified<br>
            and you know you havent done it... it could be a good idea to look it over.
        </p>
        <h5 class="odd">Back-up</h5>
        <p class="even">
            This feature is both manual and automatic.<br>
            Set the automatic backup to run after every scan but max after certain amount of time to not flood the server with backup files.<br><br>
            You can of course download and delete from the admin section.<br><br>
            In the backup/download tab in admin of the module you can also configure wich github repos to follow. These will display under usefull downloads<br>
            showing latest releases so you can keep following them.<br><br>
            The github free api being used allow 60 loadings per minute. During development/testing this could result in an empty page.<br><br>Just wait a few minutes to refresh.
        </p>
